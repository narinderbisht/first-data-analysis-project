# Project Overview

In this project, you will analyze a company's sales data to uncover insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance. You will clean and analyze the data using Python (Pandas), visualize trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn, and summarize the findings in a simple report or dashboard.

## Dataset:

Use the **"Superstore Sales Dataset"** from Kaggle, which contains sales data including:

**Order Details:** Order ID, Order Date, Ship Date.
**Product Info:** Product Category, Sub-category, and Product Name.
**Sales Metrics:** Sales, Profit, Quantity, and Discount.
**Customer Info:** Customer Name, Segment, and Region.

## CSV Data set.

This project use the data set from [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final).

## Tasks to Complete

1. **Data Cleaning (using Pandas):**

   - Handle missing values, if any.
   - Convert data types for date columns (e.g., Order Date to datetime).
   - Remove duplicates.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Use Python and SQL to answer the following questions:

   - Overall Sales Performance: What is the total sales and profit?
   - Regional Trends: Which region has the highest and lowest sales?
   - Top-Selling Products: Which product categories and subcategories contribute the most to sales?
   - Customer Insights: Which customer segment brings in the most profit?
   - Monthly Trends: How do sales and profit vary over months and years?

3. **Data Visualization:**

- Use Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize key findings:

  - A bar chart of total sales and profit per region.
  - A line chart showing monthly sales trends.
  - A heatmap of correlations (e.g., between discount, sales, and profit).
  - A pie chart of product category contribution to sales.
